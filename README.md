# JoeGame
A 30-Day final project for an Introduction to Software Development class. Made from scratch in C++/SFML in a team of 5.

# Controls
Use the W and D keys to move from left to right, and Spacebar to jump. Aim with the mouse cursor, and shoot with the left mouse button. Right mouse button switches between shooting, placing Attractors and placing Repellers. Press E to open shop (when available).

# Instructions
Destroy crystals to collect their respective gems, avoid and kill zombies to collect gold. Spend these resources at the shop, to craft Magnets (Attractors and Repellers), replentish health and buy Anti-Magnetic ammo (next 15 rounds are not affected by magnets). Place Magnets in a thoughtfull manner to reach the exit (blue portal).

# Considerations
The game consists of only one level, with a few bugs here and there due to project time constraints.
